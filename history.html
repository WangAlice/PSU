	<p> <img class='imgside' src='inductioncoil.jpg'> <b>1836:</b> The induction coil was the “first” transformer, which was the first step into 
	creating a device that. It is made up of 2 coils, the inner and outer coil. Like a transformer, 
	it changes the voltage either higher or lower than the input voltage. <br>
	 <br>
	<b>1910:</b> Charles F. Kettering invented an inductive discharge ignition system for his company, for
	 Cadillac. The Kettering ignition system is a mechanically-switched version of the original color; the 
	 transformer is the ignition coil. Variations of this were used as recently as the 1960s. <br>
	<br>
	<b>1926</b> Philip Ray Coursey created the 'Electrical Condenser'; a high frequency welding and furnaces, 
	among other uses. <br>
	<br>
	<b>1959</b> Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs invented The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect 
	transistor). It then became the most widely used power device for switching power supplies<br>
	<br>
	Transistor oscillation and rectifying converter power supply system was created by Joseph E. Murphy and Francis J. Starzec, from General Motors Company <br>
	<br>
	<img class='imgside' src='apollo.jpg'> <b>1960s</b> The Apollo Guidance Computer was developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory for NASA’s ambitious moon missions (1966-1972). It 
	incorporated early switched power supplies.<br> 
	<br>
	<b>1970</b> Tektronix starts using High-Efficiency Power Supply in its 7000-series oscilloscopes produced <br>
	<br>
	<b>1972</b> HP-35, Hewlett-Packard's first pocket calculator, is introduced with transistor switching power supply.<br>
	<br>
	<b>1973</b> Xerox uses switching power supplies in the Alto minicomputer. <br>
	<br>
	<b>1976</b> Robert Mammano developed the first integrated circuit for SMPS control, the SG1524. <br>
	<br>
	<b>1977</b> Apple designed a switching mode power supply. <br>
	<br> <img class='imgside' src='agilent.jpeg'>
	<b>1980</b> The HP8662A 10 kHz – 1.28 GHz synthesized signal generator went with a switched mode power supply. Although this is still very old, it set up the basis and
	technology for the PSU we now know today.
